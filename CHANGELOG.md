# Changelog

## v0.12.8 — Fix Linux OOM crash (2026-04-16)

### Fixed
- Linux WebKit web process no longer grows unbounded to 8–12 GB and self-kills. Memory now oscillates at ~0.85–1.6 GB during heavy scrolling on Linux and Windows. Root cause: the Blossom SHA-256 URL auto-detection regex introduced in v0.12.6 caused 3–5× more `<img>` elements per feed page, which combined with WebKitGTK's weak bitmap eviction pushed the WebProcess past its self-kill threshold. Blossom URL auto-detection is temporarily disabled pending proper validation in v0.12.9.
- WebKit rendering: `WEBKIT_FORCE_SOFTWARE_RENDERING=1` on Linux to keep the Wayland compositor path intact on Hyprland.
- `fetchNotifications` was firing 3× in the first 8 seconds of login; now fires once and the first background poll is delayed to 90s.

### Changed
- v0.12.7 OOM firefighting reverted: follow feed back to 100 events, global feed caches up to 200 — matching pre-crisis v0.12.6 behavior.

## v0.12.7 — Upload Fixes (2026-04-13)

### Fixed
- Image uploads now work again — nostr.build and files.sovbit.host endpoints updated to their current NIP-96 URLs; removed void.cat (dead) and nostrcheck.me (returned broken URLs without file extensions)
- NIP-98 HTTP Auth header now includes the required SHA-256 payload hash, fixing rejections from strict NIP-96 servers
- SVG files are now rejected with a clear error message before upload in profile picture, banner, compose box, and inline reply — SVGs were silently uploading but rendering as broken images on all Nostr clients

## v0.12.6 — Rich Text Everywhere (2026-04-10)

### Added
- Profile bios now render clickable links, `@mentions`, and `#hashtags` — profiles link to other profiles automatically
- DM messages now render clickable URLs, inline images, nostr entity links, and hashtags
- Article editor: selecting multiple images now inserts all of them correctly (previously only the last one was kept)
- Article editor: image thumbnail strip is now clickable — opens a full-size lightbox

### Fixed
- Blossom / NIP-96 image URLs with non-standard extensions (`.jp`, no extension) now render as inline images
- `nostr:` entity matching made case-insensitive for broader compatibility
- Multi-image article upload now inserts images with proper spacing between them

## v0.12.5 — UI Polish & Consistency (2026-04-09)

### Fixed
- V4V auto-streaming now stays off when manually disabled mid-episode; previously any play/pause/seek event would re-engage it for the same episode

### Changed
- Sentence case applied consistently to all button labels, tab labels, status text, and placeholders across every view
- All hard-coded colors (`amber-*`, `gray-*`, `bg-white`, `text-white` on non-colored backgrounds) replaced with theme tokens — correct appearance across all 7 themes
- All debug logging routed through `debug.ts` — production builds are fully silent (zero `console.*` leaks)
- Unicode punctuation: `...` → `…`, ASCII `x` close buttons → `×` throughout
- Hover `title` tooltips added to all truncated text (names, NIP-05, relay URLs, npub/nsec)
- Focus rings added to interactive elements for keyboard navigation
- `aria-label` added to all icon-only buttons

## v0.12.4 — Polls, Custom Relay & UI Polish (2026-04-06)
