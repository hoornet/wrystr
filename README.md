# Vega

> **Wrystr is now Vega.** Same project, same developer, new name. If you were using Wrystr, your data migrates automatically on first launch — no action needed. [Read more about the rename.](#wrystr-is-now-vega)

A cross-platform desktop Nostr client built with Tauri 2.0 + React + TypeScript. Polished UI, deep Lightning integration, and first-class support for long-form writing.

> Named after Jurij Vega (1754–1802), a Slovenian mathematician who made knowledge accessible through his pioneering logarithm tables — just as Vega makes writing accessible on Nostr.

## Wrystr is now Vega

In March 2026, Wrystr was renamed to **Vega** — named after [Jurij Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurij_Vega) (1754–1802), a Slovenian mathematician and artillery officer from the same region as the developer. Vega made knowledge accessible through his pioneering logarithm tables; this project aims to do the same for writing on Nostr.

**Why rename?** Wrystr was a working title that never rolled off the tongue. With real users arriving, it was time for a name that's easy to say, easy to remember, and carries meaning.

**What changed:**
- GitHub repo: `hoornet/wrystr` → `hoornet/vega` (old URLs redirect)
- AUR package: `wrystr-git` → `vega-nostr-git`
- Binary name: `wrystr` → `vega`
- Database: auto-migrates `wrystr.db` → `vega.db` on first launch
- Settings, keychain, localStorage: preserved automatically, no action needed

**What didn't change:** The code, the features, the developer, the license. It's the same project.
