# Wrystr

A cross-platform desktop Nostr client built with Tauri 2.0 + React + TypeScript. Polished UI, deep Lightning integration, and first-class support for long-form writing.

> Named as a nod to Nostr with a wry twist.

## Features

**Identity & accounts**
- In-app key generation with plain-language nsec backup — no browser extension required
- **Create new account** from the account switcher — no need to restart or go through onboarding again
- Login with nsec (full access) or npub (read-only)
- **Multi-account switcher** — save multiple identities, switch instantly from the sidebar
- **OS keychain integration** — nsec stored in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service; sessions survive restarts

**Feed & content**
- Global and following feeds with live relay connection
- Compose notes, inline replies, full thread view
- **Image paste in compose** — paste an image from clipboard → auto-uploads and inserts the URL
- Reactions (NIP-25) with live network counts
- Follow / unfollow (NIP-02) with contact list publishing
- **Quote & Repost** (NIP-18) — one-click repost or quote with compose modal
- **Mute users** (NIP-51) — muted list synced to relays, filtered from feed
- Long-form article editor + reader (NIP-23) — write with title, tags, cover image, auto-save; click any `nostr:naddr1…` link to open in the in-app reader
- **Quoted note inline preview** — `nostr:note1…` / `nostr:nevent1…` renders as an inline card
- Note rendering: images, video, mentions, hashtags, njump.me link interception
- **Direct Messages** (NIP-04) — conversation list, thread view, per-message decryption

**Lightning & zaps**
- **Per-account NWC wallet** — each account remembers its own Lightning wallet; switching accounts loads the correct one automatically
- **NWC guided wizard** — wallet picker (Alby Hub, Alby Extension, Mutiny, Phoenix) with per-wallet setup steps and inline URI validation
- Send zaps via NWC (NIP-47 + NIP-57) with amount presets, custom amounts, comment
- Zap counts on notes (⚡ N sats inline)
- **Zap history** — Received and Sent tabs with amounts, counterparts, comments
- **Support / About page** — zap the developer, Lightning + Bitcoin QR codes, Ko-fi and GitHub links

**Performance & UX**
- **Auto-updater** — "Update & restart" banner when a new version is available
- **SQLite note cache** — feed loads instantly from local cache on startup; profiles cached for immediate avatar display
- **System tray** — close button hides to tray; "Quit" in tray menu to fully exit
- Collapsible sidebar (icon-only mode)
- Search: NIP-50 full-text, `#hashtag`, people search with inline follow
- Relay management: add/remove relays with live connection status
