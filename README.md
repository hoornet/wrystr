# Vega

> **Wrystr is now Vega.** Same project, same developer, new name. If you were using Wrystr, your data migrates automatically on first launch — no action needed. [Read more about the rename.](#wrystr-is-now-vega)

A cross-platform desktop Nostr client built with Tauri 2.0 + React + TypeScript. Polished UI, deep Lightning integration, and first-class support for long-form writing.

> Named after Jurij Vega (1754–1802), a Slovenian mathematician who made knowledge accessible through his pioneering logarithm tables — just as Vega makes writing accessible on Nostr.

## Download

Grab the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hoornet/vega/releases).

| Platform | File | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu / Debian / Mint | `.deb` | `sudo dpkg -i vega_*.deb` |
| Fedora | `.rpm` | `sudo rpm -i vega-*.rpm` |
| openSUSE | `.rpm` | `sudo zypper install vega-*.rpm` |
| Arch / Manjaro | AUR | `yay -S vega-nostr-git` |
| Windows | `.exe` installer | run the installer |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `aarch64.dmg` | open and drag to Applications |

**Windows note:** The installer is not yet code-signed. Windows SmartScreen will show an "Unknown publisher" warning — click "More info → Run anyway" to install.

**Linux note:** Video and audio playback requires GStreamer codec packages. The AUR package installs these automatically. For `.deb`/`.rpm` installs, you may need:
```bash
# Arch / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-libav

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-libav

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-libav
```

### Verifying signatures

Release updater artifacts (`.tar.gz`, `.nsis.zip`, `.app.tar.gz`) include `.sig` files signed with minisign. To verify:

```bash
# Save the public key
echo "untrusted comment: minisign public key: F9D2C39297592652
RWRSJlmXksPS+cSpOrnmUpmJSebrbT1gxNeS33X/S7fxBAb/SdvWewNm" > vega.pub

# Verify an artifact
minisign -Vm vega_0.12.1_amd64.AppImage.tar.gz -p vega.pub
```

**Note:** The standalone `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.dmg` installers do not have signatures yet — only the updater bundles do.

## Wrystr is now Vega

In March 2026, Wrystr was renamed to **Vega** — named after [Jurij Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurij_Vega) (1754–1802), a Slovenian mathematician and artillery officer from the same region as the developer. Vega made knowledge accessible through his pioneering logarithm tables; this project aims to do the same for writing on Nostr.

**Why rename?** Wrystr was a working title that never rolled off the tongue. With real users arriving, it was time for a name that's easy to say, easy to remember, and carries meaning.

**What changed:**
- GitHub repo: `hoornet/wrystr` → `hoornet/vega` (old URLs redirect)
- AUR package: `wrystr-git` → `vega-nostr-git`
- Binary name: `wrystr` → `vega`
- Database: auto-migrates `wrystr.db` → `vega.db` on first launch
- Settings, keychain, localStorage: preserved automatically, no action needed

**What didn't change:** The code, the features, the developer, the license. It's the same project.

## Acknowledgements

Vega is built on the shoulders of excellent open-source projects:

- [NDK (Nostr Dev Kit)](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk) by [Pablo Fernandez](https://github.com/pablof7z) — the Nostr protocol library that powers all relay communication
- [Nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) by [fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf) — the protocol itself
- [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) — the frontend stack
- [ants](https://github.com/dergigi/ants) by [Gigi](https://github.com/dergigi) — inspiration and Nostr ecosystem advocacy
