# Vega — Roadmap

---

## Vision: more than a Nostr client

Vega is not just a great desktop Nostr client. **Long-form content is a first-class,
distinguishing feature** — not an afterthought, not a checkbox NIP.

The article editor (NIP-23), the reading experience, the writing tools around it — these
set Vega apart from other clients and define its identity. Think of it as a publishing
platform that happens to live on Nostr, not a social feed that happens to support articles.

### v0.9.1 — Live Feed & Relay Reliability
- **Live streaming feed** — persistent relay subscriptions (`closeOnEose: false`) deliver new notes in real-time; no manual refresh needed. Inspired by Wisp's streaming architecture.
- **Timeouts on all relay fetches** — every `fetchEvents` call across the entire codebase now has a timeout (5–12s depending on query type). No view can hang indefinitely.
- **Fixed relay death spiral** — removed aggressive liveness probe that was force-disconnecting working relays; `ensureConnected` now trusts `relay.connected` and only reconnects when zero relays are connected
- **NDK subscription hygiene** — `groupable: false` prevents NDK from batching/reusing stale subscriptions; `since` filters on global (2h) and follow (24h) feeds ensure freshness
- **Feed diagnostics** — `feedDiagnostics.ts` tracks every feed fetch with timing, event freshness, relay states; console helpers `__feedDiag()`, `__feedDiagRelays()`; periodic relay snapshots
- **NDK reset as last resort** — `resetNDK()` destroys and recreates the NDK instance (preserving signer) when relay connections are unrecoverable; triggered automatically after 30s of continuous failure
- **Fixed Articles Latest** — article feed no longer wipes results when follows array changes
- **Fixed Zap History** — loading state initialised correctly; increased timeout for zap queries (12s)

### v0.9.0 — Thread Conversation Overhaul

- **Reply to any note** — inline reply boxes open directly below the note you're replying to; proper NIP-10 root + reply marker tagging
- **Recursive reply fetching** — 2-round-trip strategy discovers deep replies (replies to replies) that were previously invisible
- **Ancestor chain** — compact parent notes shown above the root when opening a deep reply from the feed
- **Multi-level back navigation** — 20-entry navigation stack retraces your exact path through threads
- **Smart "replying to" links** — scrolls to parent note if visible, otherwise opens parent thread
- **Thread collapse** — threads with >3 replies show first 2 + "show N more" button
- **Mute filtering in trees** — muted subtrees pruned with "N replies hidden" indicator
- **Loading shimmer** — animated skeleton blocks while thread data loads
- **Podcast subscriptions** — My Podcasts tab, episode playback with V4V streaming sats

### v0.8.4 — Codebase Refactor & Docs
- **Codebase refactor** — split 5 overgrown files into focused modules: `client.ts` (1036 lines) into 11 domain files under `lib/nostr/`; `ProfileView`, `NoteContent`, and `NoteCard` split into sub-components. All component files now ≤270 lines, all lib files ≤300
- **Documentation** — Supported NIPs table in README, updated features list, current roadmap
